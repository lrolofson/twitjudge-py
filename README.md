## license

twitjudge.py v0.01 is licensed under the GPLv3. i have no idea why you would want to fork this or even use it but hey, if you want to then by all means i won't try and stop you.

## disclaimer

the code is messy as all get out, and isn't really ready for public consumption. **i provide zero guarantee that this code will run properly**. also, because i was really punchy when i wrote it and thought it was funny at the time the script talks like a certain very influential twitter personality, which i intend to change at some point and apologize for how lame it is. however, you only yolo once so i'm making it public. please be nice, or if you can't be nice, at least be constructive.
