# twitjudge.py v0.01
reads your twitter archive tweet-by-tweet, asks if you want to keep them, and dumps the id strings into a whitelist file for your tweet deleter. written in python 3.7.

## usage
savetwit.py is intended to be run from inside your twitter archive folder, but you can run it from anywhere you wish, i'm not your boss

`python savetwit.py /path/to/tweet.js /path/to/whitelist.txt`

a list of ids for deleted tweets is saved to bodied.txt in the directory the script is run from.

## disclaimer:

this code is messy as all get out, and isn't really ready for public consumption yet. since this is my first public project, though, i'm willing to make mistakes. as they say, you only yolo once. please be nice.
